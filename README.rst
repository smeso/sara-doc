**S.A.R.A.** (**S.A.R.A. is Another Recursive Acronym**) is a stacked Linux Security
Module that aims to collect heterogeneous security measures, providing a common
interface to manage them.

The kernel-space part is complemented by its user-space counterpart: `saractl`.
A test suite for WX Protection, called `sara-test`, is also available.
More information about where to find these tools and the full S.A.R.A.
documentation can be found at https://sara.smeso.it.
